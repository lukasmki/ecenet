# ECENet

**ECENet** is an SO(3)-equivariant interatomic potential (MLIP). It uses
per-edge, SO(2)-equivariant features and passes SO(3)-equivariant messages through the nodes. The use of SO(2) features enables faster, more expressive operations than is possible with SO(3) features.

- SO(3)-invariant energies.
- Equivariant message passing.
- Energy / forces / stress via autograd; ASE calculator for MD and relaxations.

> 📄 **Paper forthcoming.** A preprint describing the method is in preparation.

## Install

ECENet needs PyTorch, NumPy, ASE, and `sphericart-torch` (for spherical
harmonics). Install it as a package (editable, so `import ecenet` resolves from
anywhere):

```bash
conda create -n ecenet python=3.11
conda activate ecenet
pip install -e .
```

On a GPU machine, install the torch wheel that matches your CUDA version first
(see <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>), then `pip install -e .`.

ECENet is pure PyTorch — no compiled/custom CUDA extensions to build. The
optional fused kernels (below) use Triton, which ships with CUDA builds of
PyTorch and is JIT-compiled at runtime; without Triton or a GPU the same code
paths run as pure-PyTorch fallbacks.

**Tested with:** Python 3.11 + CUDA PyTorch (cluster) and Python 3.14 + PyTorch
2.10 CPU (local); NumPy 2.4, ASE 3.28. The dependency floors in `pyproject.toml`
are deliberately conservative.

## Quickstart

Run everything from the repo root so `import ecenet` resolves. All three trainers
are **import-and-call** — every option is a keyword argument of the training
function. The multi-GPU trainers (`train_ecenet_spice`, `train_ecenet_mptrj`)
additionally keep a `__main__` entry point so they launch directly under
`torchrun`; set hyperparameters in the call at the bottom of the script (or
import the function from your own driver).

Train on an rMD17 / MD22 molecule (import-and-call):

```python
from scripts.train_ecenet import train_ecenet
model, results = train_ecenet(molecule='ethanol', n_train=950,
                              l_max=3, n_max=4, embed_dim=16, n_epochs=200,
                              n_mp=2)            # n_mp ≥ 2 turns on message passing
```

Optional low-rank equivariant layers (off by default, available on every trainer
as well as `ecenet.ECENet(...)`) — down → nonlinearity at `r` → up, with a
zero-init up-projection, so each layer is the identity at initialisation:

```python
train_ecenet(..., bottleneck_dim=16)
```

### FiLM gate

`element_film=True` modulates the edge features once — right after they are
built and rotated into the bond frame, before the equivariant layer stack. A
small MLP on `[embed(type_i), embed(type_j), φ(r_ij)]` predicts a scale `γ`
(and optionally a shift `β`), applied as `γ⊙A + β`:

```python
train_ecenet(..., element_film=True, film_n_rbf=8)   # element + distance
train_ecenet(..., element_film=True)                 # element-only (film_n_rbf=0)
```

The gate MLP's last layer is zero-init, so `γ=1`, `β=0`, and the model is
unchanged at initialisation — the gate learns away from the identity.

| option | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `film_n_rbf` | size of the radial leg `φ(r_ij)`; `0` (default) makes the gate element-only, so `γ` does not vary with bond length |
| `film_embed_dim` | width of each element embedding (default 16) |
| `film_hidden` | gate-MLP hidden width(s); `None` → `[max(2*C, 32)]` |
| `film_per_m` | emit a scale per `(channel, m)` instead of one per channel broadcast over `m` |
| `film_shift` | also predict a shift `β`, as an extra head on the *same* MLP |

Both extras keep the symmetry intact, which constrains where they may act.
`A_cos` and `A_sin` of a given `(channel, m)` share `γ`, so a per-`m` scale still
commutes with the bond frame's per-mode SO(2) rotation; the structural-zero slots
(`m > l` of that channel) are masked to `γ=1`. An additive shift does *not*
commute with that rotation, so `β` lands on the `m=0` slot of `A_cos` only — the
rotation-invariant mode, and the one place a shift is exactly equivariant.

### Charge and spin

By default ECENet is a pure function of geometry and composition: a cation and
its neutral parent, frozen at the same geometry, are the same input and get the
same energy. `charge_spin=True` adds the missing variable — the structure's
**total charge** `Q` (in e) and **total spin** `S` (unpaired electrons,
`multiplicity - 1`) — passed per call on every forward path:

```python
model = ECENet(..., charge_spin=True)

model(pos, types)                                     # neutral, closed shell
model(pos, types, total_charge=1.0)                   # cation
model(pos, types, total_charge=-1.0, total_spin=1.0)  # doublet anion
model.forward_batch_multi(pos_list, types_list,       # per-structure states
                          total_charge=[0., 1., -1.], total_spin=[0., 0., 1.])
```

Omitting them means neutral and closed-shell, which is why every existing call
site keeps working. A model built *without* `charge_spin` that is handed a
nonzero charge warns once rather than quietly returning the neutral energy.

The state reaches the model as the invariant vector `[Q, S, Q/N, S/N]`
(`ecenet/electronic.py`) at two sites, both identity at initialisation:

| option | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `charge_spin_film` | a FiLM gate on the edge features, beside the element gate — the site that reaches everything downstream (energies, forces, LES latent charges, mixture invariants). Default `True` |
| `charge_spin_atomic` | a per-atom state-conditioned energy added to the `atomic_energy` baseline. Edge-free, so it is the only term that survives for an isolated ion. Default `True` |
| `charge_spin_embed_dim` | width of the element embedding in both heads (default 16) |
| `charge_spin_hidden` | hidden width(s) of both heads |
| `charge_spin_per_m` | per-`(channel, m)` gate instead of per-channel, exactly as `film_per_m` |
| `charge_spin_shift` | the gate also emits the `m=0` shift `β`, as `film_shift` (default `True`) |

Both `Q, S` and `Q/N, S/N` are supplied on purpose. The intensive pair is what
keeps a sum-of-local-terms energy size-consistent — two copies of a `+1` ion see
the same `Q/N` as one — while the extensive pair is needed because the response
to adding *one* electron is not intensive at all (the electron affinity of a
10-atom cluster is not a tenth of a 100-atom one's).

The gate is equivariant for the same reason the element gate is: the state
vector is an invariant scalar, `γ` is shared by `cos` and `sin` of a given
`(channel, m)`, and `β` touches the `m=0` slot only. Energy stays continuous at
`r_cut_edge`, forces stay conservative, and double backward (force training)
works.

#### At inference (ASE)

`ECENetCalculator` reads the state off each `Atoms` object — most explicit
first: a calculator-level `charge=` / `spin=` override, then `atoms.info`
(`'charge'`/`'total_charge'`, and `'spin'`/`'total_spin'` or
`'multiplicity'`/`'spin_multiplicity'`, the keys extended-XYZ round-trips), then
`get_initial_charges().sum()` / `|get_initial_magnetic_moments().sum()|`.

```python
calc = load_calculator('model.mdl')

atoms.info['charge'] = 1          # or atoms.info['multiplicity'] = 3
atoms.calc = calc
atoms.get_potential_energy()      # the cation's energy

calc = load_calculator('model.mdl', charge=1)   # fix the state for a whole MD run
```

ASE's own `check_state` ignores `atoms.info`, so the calculator extends it: a
change of charge or spin invalidates the cached result, and
`atoms.info['charge'] = 1` means what it says even on a calculator that has
already seen the neutral geometry.

> yet read a per-structure charge/spin out of their datasets — a run today

> next step.

### Mixture of experts (EVB)

`n_experts=K` replaces the single scalar read-out with **K expert energies plus
learned couplings**, mixed by the empirical-valence-bond construction: build a
real-symmetric Hamiltonian from the experts and take its lowest eigenvalue.

$$H_{ij}(\mathbf R) = \delta_{ij}V_i(\mathbf R) + (1-\delta_{ij})C_{ij}(\mathbf R),
\qquad V_{\mathrm{EVB}} = \lambda_{\min}[\mathbf H],
\qquad w_i = c_{0i}^2$$

The gate and the expert coupling become one object — the ground-state
eigenvector — instead of a softmax bolted on beside the experts. For two experts
the eigenvalue is closed form,

$$V = \tfrac12(V_A+V_B) - \sqrt{\tfrac14(V_A-V_B)^2 + C^2},$$

a hyperbolic regularisation of `min(V_A, V_B)`: far from a crossing the lower
expert dominates, near one the coupling opens a smooth avoided crossing, and at
`C = 0` it degenerates exactly to the hard minimum. Unlike a convex mixture the
result sits *below* every expert, so the experts are best read as a learned
diabatic basis rather than as physical energies in their own right.

```python
train_ecenet_moe(..., n_experts=4, moe_mixture='evb')      # the EVB mixture
train_ecenet_moe(..., n_experts=4, moe_mixture='moe')      # softmax-gated baseline
compare_mixtures(..., n_experts=4)                          # all rules, one split
```

`scripts/train_ecenet_moe.py` is the entry point (a thin layer over the
small-dataset trainer, which carries the diversity regulariser and the per-epoch
`experts [...]` usage log); `compare_mixtures` trains the same architecture under
each rule so a table difference is a mixing-rule difference and nothing else.

Those runs share a trunk but *not* a parameter count — K expert heads plus
K(K-1)/2 coupling heads cost more read-out weights than one head.
`matched_single_head` supplies the control that holds capacity fixed instead: it
solves for the read-out width that makes a plain `n_experts=1` model the same
size, spending the extra parameters where the mixture spends them, so a
difference is attributable to the read-out's *structure*.

```python
ARCH = dict(n_experts=4, l_max=3, embed_dim=32, n_layers=2, n_max_d=8, n_mp=2)
train_ecenet_moe(**ARCH, ...)                          # the mixture
train_ecenet_xyz(**matched_single_head(**ARCH), ...)   # same size, one head
```

Widening the *trunk* to match instead (`embed_dim`, `n_layers`) answers a
different question — whether those parameters would have been better spent on
the encoder — and neither control subsumes the other.

| option | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `n_experts` | K. `1` (default) is the plain single-head model — no mixture parameters, unchanged numerics |
| `moe_mixture` | `'evb'` (coupled eigenvalue), `'moe'` (softmax gate, the baseline), `'softmin'` (`-τ log Σ e^{-V_i/τ}`), `'mean'` |
| `moe_scope` | `'atom'` (default): one K×K problem per atom. `'global'`: one per structure — the literal EVB formulation |
| `moe_coupling` | `'mlp'` learned `C(R)`, `'const'` per-type constants, `'none'` → `C ≡ 0`, i.e. `min_i V_i` |
| `moe_coupling_topology` | `'full'`, `'chain'` (sparse tridiagonal H), `'none'` |
| `moe_coupling_init` | initial per-(type, pair) coupling in eV/atom; nonzero on purpose (see below) |
| `moe_expert_init` | std of the per-(type, expert) baseline — the symmetry breaker between experts |
| `moe_diversity_weight` | weight of the expert-collapse regulariser (`'load'`, `'entropy'` or `'cv'`); a *training* option, not saved in `hparams` |
| `moe_freeze_experts` | stage 2 of the two-stage recipe: restart from a specialised checkpoint and train *only* the couplings |

**Forces come out conservative for free.** Hellmann–Feynman gives
`F = -c₀ᵀ(∇H)c₀` = weighted expert forces + coupling forces, and since the model
is still a plain differentiable scalar, autograd computes exactly that — verified
against an explicit frozen-eigenvector construction in `tests/test_moe.py`.

**Two things to know before turning it on.**

*Scope and size consistency.* λ_min is superadditive, so `moe_scope='global'`
does **not** decompose over non-interacting subsystems: two molecules 60 Å apart
give more than the sum of their energies. The default `'atom'` scope solves one
Hamiltonian per atom and is exactly additive, keeps the read-out local like the
rest of the model, and makes the couplings intensive. Use `'global'` for
fixed-size systems or to reproduce the theory as written.

*Degeneracy and the gap.* The gradient of an eigenvalue never needs a gap, but
the *second* derivative — which is what force training differentiates through —
scales as `1/(E₁-E₀)`. Nonzero couplings keep that gap open (it is `2|C|` at
K=2), which is why `moe_coupling_init` defaults to a nonzero value and why K=2
uses the analytic closed form rather than an eigensolver. A run with all
couplings driven to zero *and* two experts crossing is the case to watch.

*Expert collapse* is the standard MoE failure mode and survives translation: if
one expert sits below the others everywhere, `c₀ → (1, 0, …, 0)` and the rest are
dead weight. Watch the `experts [...]` line; `moe_diversity_weight` is the blunt
lever, and specialising the experts through the training data is usually the
better one.

### Message passing

With `n_mp >= 2`, every message-passing layer computes, per edge, a low-rank
**message** and an invariant scalar **score**, aggregates the messages at each
receiver atom in the common global frame, and passes the result through a
**receiver** transform back in the bond frame. `mp_type` selects how the
per-edge weight is formed:

```python
train_ecenet(..., n_mp=2, mp_type='softmax', mp_n_heads=4)   # default
train_ecenet(..., n_mp=2, mp_type='sum')
```

| `mp_type` | weight | behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `'softmax'` (default) | `exp(s)·f_cut / Σ_{e→j}(exp(s)·f_cut)` | softmax over the receiver's incoming edges — a weighted *average*, intensive in coordination |
| `'sum'` | `s·f_cut` | raw signed score × cutoff envelope — *extensive* in coordination, and signed, so a neighbour can contribute negatively |

Either way the smooth cutoff envelope keeps the energy continuous as an edge
crosses `r_cut_edge`.

`mp_msg_envelope` (on by default) makes the aggregated message decay with
*absolute* distance. It matters only for `'softmax'`: the softmax normalizer
divides the absolute `f_cut` back out, leaving only the relative cutoff across a
receiver's in-edges — so without it a lone neighbour near `r_cut` still gets
weight ≈ 1 and the message is essentially flat in distance. Multiplying `f_cut`
back in fixes that (measured on a dimer, the weight then equals `f_cut` exactly,
falling ~32× from 1.5 Å to 4.5 Å instead of staying at 1.000). `'sum'` is already
enveloped by construction, so the flag is a no-op there — and setting it `False`
warns rather than silently doing nothing.

Message and scores share **one fused trunk**: a low-rank block (down →
nonlinearity at `mp_dim` → up) whose up-projection emits `2*embed_dim*(l_max+1)`
message channels plus one score channel per head, the score being that channel's
`m=0` (rotation-invariant) component. Sharing a trunk is cheaper than a separate
message block and score head. The up-projection is zero-init, so at
initialisation the message residual and every score are 0 — which makes `'sum'`
an exact no-op and leaves `'softmax'` with uniform attention (`exp(0) = 1`).

`mp_dim` sets that trunk's bottleneck width (and the receiver's); `mp_n_heads`
splits the value channels (`2*embed_dim`) into that many attention heads, so it
must divide them evenly.

`mp_l_attention` gives each head one score **per degree `l`** instead of one
overall, so a neighbour can be weighted differently for `l=1` than for `l=2`.
Each `(head, l)` then runs its own independent softmax over the receiver's
in-edges, and the fused trunk widens to `n_ch + n_heads*(l_max+1)`. This stays
equivariant because the Wigner-D block is `l`-diagonal: an invariant scalar
applied uniformly across one `l`'s whole `m`-block commutes with the rotation.
Splitting *within* an `l`, across `m`, would not — which is why the weight is
expanded through a fixed `l_of_s` map rather than being free per spherical
index.

> been removed. Checkpoints trained with it (identifiable by `W_msg` weights) are

### Long-range electrostatics (LES, optional)

ECENet's message passing sees only atoms within `r_cut_edge`. The optional
**LES** add-on (Latent Ewald Summation) closes that gap: a head predicts a
scalar latent charge per atom from the model's invariant `l0` embedding, and
the long-range energy is the smeared-Coulomb interaction between those charges
(reciprocal-space Ewald for periodic systems), summed into the total energy on
one shared autograd graph so forces and stress need no extra code.

The implementation is **not vendored** — `ecenet.les.LESLongRange` wraps the
inventors' reference package, installed separately (pinned; it is not on PyPI):

```bash
pip install -e ".[les]"     # or directly:
pip install "les @ git+https://github.com/ChengUCB/les@c8063fad18e3d59cb4d783e0ed5a1efea8d55b8d"
```

`LESLongRange()(l0, positions, cell=None, batch=None)` returns the long-range
energy; the upstream package's own head maps `l0` to latent charges, so the
wrapper's state dict is exactly the upstream module's. The model exposes `l0`
on every forward variant — `l0_only=True` skips the `l=1` work (`l0` is
rotation-invariant, so it needs no frame change; a charge is a scalar, so the
head never sees `l1`):

```python
lr = ecenet.LESLongRange()
E_sr, l0 = model(pos, types, return_embeddings=True, l0_only=True)
E = E_sr + lr(l0, pos).sum()      # one autograd graph → forces via autograd
```

The batched paths (`forward_batch`, `forward_batch_multi`) return `l0` as a
per-structure list.

**Joint training** (`use_les=True`) is available on all four trainers —
`E = E_sr + E_lr` minimised on one autograd graph, forces from the same
graph. `scripts/train_ecenet_xyz.py` is the single-process, in-memory
reference for any ASE-readable file (extxyz etc.); stress strain-transforms
the cell alongside positions and shifts so the Ewald part is covered too:

```python
from scripts.train_ecenet_xyz import train_ecenet_xyz
model, les_module, results = train_ecenet_xyz(
    train_path='data/train-H2O_RPBE-D3.xyz',
    test_path='data/test-H2O_RPBE-D3.xyz',
    use_les=True, n_epochs=200)
```

`les_readout` selects how the per-atom `l0` fed to the charge head is
aggregated from the final edge invariants (available on all trainers and
`ecenet.ECENet(...)`):

| `les_readout` | aggregation |
| --- | --- |
| `'sum'` (default) | parameter-free scatter-sum over the atom's in-edges — extensive in coordination |
| `'softmax'` | attention: a zero-init linear score on each edge's invariants, segment-softmax over the receiver's in-edges with `f_cut` as a multiplicative log-bias, envelope multiplied back in (exactly the MP layers' softmax + `mp_msg_envelope` recipe) — intensive, and decaying with absolute distance |
| `'edge'` | Allegro-LES-style per-edge charge decomposition: a linear scalar head on each edge's invariants, scatter-summed per atom — the width-1 `l0` **is** the latent charge, so upstream's atomwise head is bypassed (the wrapper is called with `l0_is_charge=True`; standard init, since a zero-init charge head would sit on the quadratic energy's gradient-free saddle) |
| `'edge_basis'` | `'edge'` upgraded to mirror the per-edge **energy** readout end to end: an MLP with the energy head's architecture (same full invariant input set, hidden widths, and activation — but standard init, since near-zero charges would start on the quadratic energy's saddle) emits `n_max_d` channels dotted with the cutoff-enveloped radial basis of the bond length, so each bond's charge contribution has a learnable distance profile and vanishes exactly at `r_cut` |

The softmax weight is an invariant scalar shared by the `l0` and `l1`
messages, so SO(3) behaviour is untouched (verified in `tests/test_les.py`,
including the closed-form dimer weight `f_cut²/(f_cut+ε)`).

For the edge modes, `les_charge_scale` (default 1.0) multiplies the emitted
latent charge by a fixed factor (MACE-LES ships 0.1 as `output_scale`): with
a standard-init head the charges then start small but nonzero — clear of the
quadratic energy's q = 0 saddle, while E_lr (quadratic in q) is suppressed
~scale² early, so the short-range fit leads and the charges grow gently
relative to it. It is not a parameter and is recorded in the checkpoint's
hparams; for `'sum'`/`'softmax'` it cannot apply (the charge is produced
inside the upstream head) and setting it warns.

`les_dipole=True` (edge modes only; `train_ecenet_xyz`, `train_ecenet_spice`,
and the tools) additionally gives every atom a **latent dipole**: the edge head
emits a second block of channels, reduced exactly like the charge, whose
scalar `d_e` contributes the bond dipole `d_e·r̂_e` at the receiver. The
model's `l0` is then packed `(n_atoms, 4) = [q | u]`, and the wrapper feeds
`u` to upstream's charge–dipole and dipole–dipole Ewald terms
(`E_lr = ½qᵀf_qq q + qᵀf_qu u + ½uᵀf_uu u`), so polarization the fixed
point charges cannot express — the physics behind the extended-LES `u`
channel — joins the same autograd graph. Because `u` is an invariant scalar
times a true polar vector, parity is exact by construction: a planar
molecule (e.g. water) cannot acquire an out-of-plane dipole, matching its
mirror symmetry — and that bond-direction span coincides with the
symmetry-allowed subspace whenever it binds (coplanar or collinear
neighbourhoods), so nothing expressible is lost. The dipole block is
zero-init — safe here, unlike the charge head, because the `qᵀf_qu u`
cross-term supplies a gradient at u = 0 — so enabling the flag changes
nothing at initialisation. The molecular dipole becomes
`μ = Σᵢ qᵢrᵢ + Σᵢ uᵢ` (`tools/eval_spice_dipoles.py` handles this
automatically). The SPICE trainer's one-batched-call path covers the dipole
terms too — the vectorized isolated path masks upstream's `f_qu`/`f_uu`
kernels exactly as it does `f_qq` (verified against upstream's per-structure
loop) — but note the dipole–dipole kernel is a `(ΣN)²·3·3` tensor, 9× the
charge kernel's memory, so dipole runs want smaller atom budgets.

`les_charges=False` (requires `les_dipole=True`; all four trainers and
`ecenet.ECENet(...)`) is the **dipoles-only** ablation: the head emits only
the dipole block and the q column of the packed l0 is exactly zero, so
`E_lr = ½uᵀf_uu u` alone — no monopole–monopole term and no q–u cross-term,
which also means inter-molecular charge transfer is inexpressible by
construction. Because that cross-term is what makes the zero-init dipole
slot trainable, the dipoles-only head gets **standard init** instead (a
zero-init u would sit on the uu-quadratic energy's gradient-free saddle,
exactly the charge head's original problem), with `les_charge_scale` now
acting on u. Everything downstream — wrapper, calculators, dumped `les_q`
(all zeros), BECs (now pure dipole flow) — works unchanged, since the l0
layout is untouched.

The SPICE trainer takes the same flags (`use_les=True`, `les_arguments`) and
trains jointly under DDP: the LES head lives inside the DDP-wrapped forward
module (so its gradients join the bucket reduction and run on every step,
keeping `find_unused_parameters=False` valid), and the long-range energy is
computed in **one batched LES call** per step — concatenated atoms plus a
structure-index vector, zero cells → the isolated pairwise path (verified
bit-identical to per-structure calls in `tests/test_spice_trainer.py`).

Upstream builds its charge head lazily on the first forward, so both trainers
materialise it with one throwaway forward before the DDP wrap / optimiser /
checkpoint restore. LES checkpoints carry a top-level `les` dict;
`ECENetCalculator.from_checkpoint` **refuses** them rather than silently
dropping the long-range term (`ignore_les=True` loads the short-range part
deliberately). For MD and single-point use, **`ECENetLESCalculator`** loads a
joint checkpoint and evaluates `E = E_sr + E_lr` on one autograd graph —
forces from the joint backward, and stress from a strain pass that strains
positions, shift vectors, *and the cell*, so the Ewald term's explicit cell
dependence is included (verified against finite differences). Non-periodic
systems use the isolated pairwise path, periodic ones reciprocal-space
Ewald; `examples/run_md_xyz.py` picks the right calculator automatically:

```python
from ecenet.calculator import ECENetLESCalculator
atoms.calc = ECENetLESCalculator.from_checkpoint('water_les.mdl')
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())   # E_sr + E_lr, eV
```

It refuses short-range checkpoints (symmetric with `ECENetCalculator`
refusing LES ones).

Every force call also exposes the per-atom latent charges — they are computed
on the way to `E_lr` anyway — via `atoms.get_charges()` (and, for `les_dipole`
checkpoints, the latent atomic dipoles as `calc.results['les_dipoles']`).
`run_md_xyz --dump_charges` writes them onto every dumped frame as `les_q` /
`les_u` extxyz columns, giving charge/dipole trajectories along MD for free
(extxyz output only — ASE's `.traj` format drops custom per-atom arrays). The
global sign of the latent charges is arbitrary (`E_lr` is quadratic in `q`):
consistent within a checkpoint, not physically pinned.

`calc.compute_bec(atoms)` returns the Born effective charges `Z* = ∂P/∂r`
as an `(N, 3, 3)` array, charge-flow terms included (upstream's BEC module
does the differentiation — Berry-phase polarization for periodic cells,
direct sum otherwise; verified against finite differences of the
polarization on a periodic box, charge flow included, in
`tests/test_xyz_trainer.py`). Unlike the charges this cannot ride along the
force call — it runs its own forward plus three backward passes (≈ 4 force
calls). `run_md_xyz --dump_bec` writes it per dumped frame as a per-atom
`bec` column of 9 row-major components (the `les_fit` reference layout).

The other two trainers take `use_les=True` as well. `train_ecenet_mptrj`
runs the **periodic** path: one batched LES call per step over the
concatenated atoms with the stacked cells (reciprocal-space Ewald per
structure), the LES head inside the DDP-wrapped forward module (as in the
SPICE trainer), and the stress strain pass covering the cell. Every frame
needs its cell tensor, which `prepare_mptrj.py` now stores — prepared dirs
written before that must be re-prepared for LES runs (a clear error says so).
`train_ecenet` (rMD17/MD22) uses the isolated pairwise path; note those
datasets are in kcal/mol while the LES Coulomb constant is eV·Å-based, so
the latent charges absorb the unit scale.

### Fused kernels (optional)

Two opt-in fused paths trade nothing numerically for memory (and, with Triton
on CUDA, HBM traffic). Both are runtime toggles on the model, off by default:

```python
model.set_edge_frame_fused(True)      # gather→Wigner-rotate→reshape as one op,
                                      # + the MP layers' pack/unrotate (e2n=True)
model.set_activation_fused(True)      # nonlinearity grid recomputed in backward
```

`set_edge_frame_fused` re-gathers in the backward instead of saving the
`(n_edges, 2C, n_sph)` intermediates; its backward is built from differentiable
ops, so it is safe for double-backward force-loss training.
`set_activation_fused` drops the `(n_edges, F, n_grid)` grid transient from the
saved-for-backward set; it is single-backward oriented — leave it off for
force-loss training. On CUDA + float32 both dispatch to Triton kernels
(`ecenet/edge_frame_kernel.py`, `ecenet/realspace_kernel.py`); elsewhere they
run equivalent pure-PyTorch fallbacks. Verified bit-identical (CPU) /
fp32-accurate (kernels) in `tests/test_edge_frame_kernel.py` and
`tests/test_realspace_kernel.py`.

### Learning-rate schedule

All three trainers take `lr_schedule`, defaulting to `'plateau'`
(`ReduceLROnPlateau` on the validation metric, as before):

```python
train_ecenet(..., lr_schedule='multistep',
             lr_milestones=[80, 130, 170, 190], lr_gamma=0.5)

train_ecenet(..., lr_schedule='cosine', warmup_epochs=5, lr_min_factor=0.01)
```

| option | applies to | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lr_milestones` | `multistep` | epochs at which the LR is multiplied by `lr_gamma` |
| `lr_gamma` | `multistep` | decay factor at each milestone (default `0.1`) |
| `warmup_epochs` | `multistep`, `cosine` | linear ramp `0 → lr` over the first N epochs |
| `lr_min_factor` | `cosine` | LR floor as a fraction of `lr`, reached exactly on the last epoch |
| `scheduler_patience` | `plateau` | unchanged |

`multistep` and `cosine` are computed as **pure functions of the epoch index**
rather than through torch's stateful schedulers. That has three consequences
worth knowing: a resumed run lands on exactly the LR a fresh run would have at
that epoch (torch's `MultiStepLR` counts `.step()` calls, so it would replay from
the initial LR); nothing needs to go in the checkpoint; and every DDP rank
computes the same LR independently, with no state to keep in sync. The
`multistep` curve is verified identical to `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.MultiStepLR`
over a full run.

### Batching and precision (SPICE / MPtrj trainers)

Two size-aware batching modes for the SPICE trainer, both off by default:

```python
train_ecenet_spice(..., bucket=True)               # size-bucketed, fixed batch_size
train_ecenet_spice(..., max_atoms_per_batch=250)   # atom budget; implies bucket
train_ecenet_spice(..., max_atoms_per_batch=250, max_batch_count=16)
```

`bucket=True` sorts the epoch's structures by atom count and batches consecutive
ones, so a batch holds similar-sized molecules rather than one giant molecule
alongside several small ones (measured: mean within-batch atom spread 0.2 vs 44.1
unsorted). `max_atoms_per_batch` goes further and packs to a total-atom budget, so
memory and compute per step are roughly uniform and a batch of several large
molecules can no longer OOM; `max_batch_count` optionally caps structures per
batch, bounding the per-structure Python overhead when a batch is all tiny
molecules.

`bucket_sort=True` (the default) sorts by atom count before packing.
`bucket_sort=False` greedy-packs the already-shuffled order instead, trading a
little DDP balance for batch diversity: with sorting, the largest, rare-size
structures keep the *same* batch-mates every epoch (measured: they retain 84% of
their batch-mates across epochs, vs 10% unsorted), which costs gradient diversity
exactly where there is least data. The atom budget still bounds per-batch cost
either way, so the per-rank load spread at `world_size=8` only loosens from 0.9%
to 2.4%. Mainly meaningful together with `max_atoms_per_batch` — without a budget,
unsorted packing is just fixed-size batches plus the round alignment.

Both share the cross-rank alignment, which is what makes them useful under DDP.
Every rank must run the same *number* of batches or the collective in backward
deadlocks, so the assignment is derived identically on every rank rather than
communicated: sort by atom count, form batches, group into rounds of
`world_size`, drop any partial final round, shuffle the round order with a shared
seed, and give rank r the r-th batch of each round. Adjacent (similar-cost)
batches share a round, so per-step work is aligned across ranks and the
molecule-size straggler disappears — the biggest win multi-node. Measured spread
in per-rank total atoms at `world_size=8`: 3.4% bucketed, 0.9% atom-budget.

The MPtrj trainer's prepared-shard mode takes the atom budget too:

```python
train_ecenet_mptrj(..., prepared_dir='mptrj_prepared', max_atoms_per_batch=250)
```

Shards stream with no random access, so there is no global sort; instead each
shard (~10k frames — an i.i.d. sample of the dataset, thanks to the
prepare-time global shuffle) is packed independently, with `bucket_sort` and
`max_batch_count` meaning the same as above. The DDP invariant is restored by
round alignment at the shard level: shards are grouped into rounds of
`world_size` (rank r owns the r-th shard of each round), every rank *plans*
every shard's packing from per-frame atom counts alone — packing depends only
on counts and the shared seed, never on the tensors — and all ranks truncate
to the round's minimum batch count. A seeded permutation decides which batches
are dropped, so with `bucket_sort` the largest-structure tail is not
systematically the part lost; the truncation loss is well under 1% at 10k
frames/shard. The counts live in an `atom_counts.pt` sidecar written by
`prepare_mptrj.py`; prepared dirs that predate it are back-filled
automatically on first use (one pass over the shards, then cached).

`precompute_topology=True` (SPICE trainer) builds every training structure's
neighbour lists once at startup and reuses them each step. Training positions
are fixed, so the topology never changes — yet the on-the-fly path recomputes
the O(N²) distance matrix and calls `nonzero` twice per structure per step,
each a GPU→CPU sync. Skipping them is numerics-identical (verified to 0 in
`tests/test_spice_trainer.py`); evaluation still builds topology on the fly.

`tf32=True` (both trainers) routes float32 matmuls to TF32 tensor cores on
Ampere+. TF32 keeps ~10 mantissa bits, so A/B the validation MAE before trusting
it. It is a float32-only mode: under `dtype=torch.float64` it warns and changes
nothing.

Train on SPICE dataset (10 elements):

```python
from scripts.train_ecenet_spice import train_ecenet_spice
model, results = train_ecenet_spice(l_max=3, n_max=4, embed_dim=32, n_layers=2)
```

Multi-GPU via `torchrun`
(`LOCAL_RANK`/`RANK`/`WORLD_SIZE` are read from the environment for DDP):

```bash
python scripts/train_ecenet_spice.py            # single process

torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 scripts/train_ecenet_spice.py    # 4-GPU DDP
```

Use a trained model from Python / ASE:

```python
from ase.io import read
from ecenet.calculator import ECENetCalculator

atoms = read('molecule.xyz')
atoms.calc = ECENetCalculator.from_checkpoint('model.mdl')
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())   # eV
print(atoms.get_forces())             # eV/Å
print(atoms.get_stress())             # eV/Å³ (periodic systems)
```

```python
import ecenet
model = ecenet.ECENet(n_types=10, l_max=3, n_max=4, embed_dim=16)
energy = model(positions, types)      # positions (N,3), types (N,)
```
