"""SO(2)-equivariant layers operating on bond-frame angular features.

Once ACE features are Wigner-rotated into a bond frame (see model.py /
ace_basis.py), each angular mode ``m`` transforms as ``e^{imφ}`` under rotation
about the bond axis. Features are carried as cos/sin Fourier pairs
``(A_cos, A_sin)`` of shape ``(n_edges, n_features, n_angular)`` with
``n_angular = m_max + 1``. This module provides the layer types that act on that
representation while preserving the SO(2) structure:

- ``EquivariantLinear``: per-mode channel mixing (block-diagonal across ``m``),
  the same weights applied to the cos and sin parts, bias only on the ``m=0``
  (invariant) channel.
- ``RealSpaceNonlinearity``: applies a pointwise nonlinearity equivariantly via
  iDFT → σ → DFT on a θ-grid, coupling modes while staying SO(2)-equivariant.
