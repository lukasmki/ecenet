    model : ECENet

    device : torch.device
    dtype  : torch.dtype
    energy_reference : dict or None
        Optional per-element reference energies {symbol: eV} to add back
        to the model's residual energy (needed if model was trained on
        residual energies).  Keys are element symbols, values are eV/atom.
    charge, spin : float or None
        Fixed electronic state for every structure this calculator sees,
        overriding whatever the Atoms object carries — for driving MD on an
        ion whose trajectory frames say nothing about their charge. ``None``
        (default) reads the state off each Atoms object; see ``_read_state``.
        Consumed only by a model built with ``charge_spin=True``, which warns
        once if handed a state it cannot use.
